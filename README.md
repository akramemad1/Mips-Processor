# Mips-Processor
## What is MIPS?
Mips is a **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing)** architecture that has been widely used in embedded systems, networking hardware, and early computer workstations. It was originally developed by MIPS Computer Systems in the 1980s. The Target Of this project is to design a MIPS Processor That is capable of executing Basic Instructions of MIPS.

## Features
1. RISC Design
2. Load/Store Architecture
3. Fixed Instruction Length: 32 bits

## MIPS instruction Types
- R-Type (Register-Register Operations)
  - ` opcode (6) | rs (5) | rt (5) | rd (5) | shamt (5) | funct (6) `
- I-Type (Immediate and Load/Store Operations)
  - `opcode (6) | rs (5) | rt (5) | immediate (16)`
- J-Type (Jump Instructions)
  - `opcode (6) | address (26)`
